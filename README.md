# Face X 
 Android App For Face attendance system 

# OverView
The purpose of this system is to to help the lecturers, improve and organize the process of tracking and managing attendance  and provides a valuable attentive 
service for both teachers and students. it Reduces manual process errors by providing automated and a reliable attendance system.
First, the software takes a picture of all authorized students and stores it in a Firebase database. The system then stores the image by mapping it into a face coordinate structure. Next time whenever the registered student capture through camera the system recognizes the Student and marks his attendance along with the time. In this way a teacher can keep track of their attendance according to their subjects and classes . and all of this data will be saved on our database .
